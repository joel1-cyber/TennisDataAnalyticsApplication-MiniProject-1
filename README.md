# TennisDataAnalyticsApplication-MiniProject-1
Technically, the project involves extracting tennis data from a relevant sports API (Tennis Data) , such as SportRadar, which provides real-time information about competitors, competitions, venues, and ranking etc. This data is then processed and stored in a MySQL relational database using python , where tables like Competitors, Competitions, and Venues are created to organize the data efficiently. The extracted data is inserted into these tables through Python, ensuring that the information is cleaned and formatted for consistency. A Streamlit application is developed to connect with the MySQL database and present the data interactively. Through this application, users can view the data and visualize insights using charts and graphs generated with libraries like Matplotlib . The application offers an intuitive web interface, allowing users to filter and analyze data dynamically, uncovering trends and insights from the tennis data.
